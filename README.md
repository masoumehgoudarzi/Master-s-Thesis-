Finite state machine modeling of human brain resting state transitions
In recent years fMRI has become a pivotal tool in neuroimaging, providing insights
into brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. At the same
time, the field has also dealt with uncertainty related to many known and unknown
effects of artifact in fMRI data and accurately separating signal from noise and
identifying meaningful patterns of brain activity. Traditional single-echo fMRI
methods are often limited by their susceptibility to artifacts and physiological noise.
This research uses multi-echo fMRI acquisitions in conjunction with a multi-echo
independent component analysis (ME-ICA) approach has been introduced as a means
to automatically distinguish functionally related BOLD signal components from
signal artifacts, with significant gains in sensitivity, statistical power, and specificity.
Moreover, the research explores the application of Finite State Machines (FSM) and
graph theory to multi-echo fMRI modeling of human brain resting state transitions.
The findings reveal that while all brain networks are functional connectivity, the
connectivity between the Default Mode Network and Motor Network, as well as
between the Motor Network and Gray Matter Network 1, are particularly notable
and highest. The results advance our understanding of neural connectivity and brain
dynamics, offering insights into cognitive and behavioral functions and contributing
to the development of targeted interventions and neuroimaging techniques.
